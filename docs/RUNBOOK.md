# TenantDesk: runbook

## Install and configure

Follow README.md with Python 3.11 or 3.12. Python 3.11 or 3.12. PostgreSQL is optional: install .[postgres,dev] and follow docs/POSTGRES.md.

Run `python -m tenantdesk setup --shared` to enter reusable provider keys through hidden prompts, then `python -m tenantdesk setup` to generate local operator tokens. A local nonempty key overrides the shared value. Leave optional keys empty. An existing local `.env` is deliberately not overwritten; edit it locally to rotate values. `PORTFOLIO_SECRETS_FILE` changes the shared-file location. Environment variables override both files.

No key for extractive answers. GROQ_API_KEY is optional for live quote selection. PostgreSQL deployment also needs runtime and admin DSNs. Never send keys in chat, URLs, screenshots, issue comments, command arguments or Git. The repository's placeholders are intentionally blank.

## Operate

`python -m tenantdesk check-keys` only reports which keys exist. `python -m tenantdesk serve --port 8020` starts the loopback API. The health endpoint proves process availability, not provider availability. Use `/docs` to inspect request schemas. Operator endpoints use API_TOKEN; invoice review uses REVIEWER_TOKEN; scoped client/account/tenant endpoints use the token returned at creation.

Local state defaults to `.data/` under the current working directory. API state can be relocated with the DATA_DIR environment variable. Protect the entire directory and its backups. Restarting preserves committed data; do not delete the database to repair a failed request. Inspect the service's state or report endpoint and its domain tests first.

## Container

```bash
docker build -t tenantdesk:local .
docker volume create tenantdesk-data
docker run --rm --env-file .env -p 127.0.0.1:8020:8020 -v tenantdesk-data:/data tenantdesk:local
```

The image runs as a non-root user. If using a bind mount instead of the named volume, give that user write access. A shared credential file outside the container is not mounted automatically; supply required variables securely. QuietScribe also needs a read-only mount containing prepared model weights.

## Verify changes

Run `python -m pytest -q`, `python -m tenantdesk demo` and `python -m pip wheel . --no-deps -w /tmp/wheels`. CI repeats unit/API checks on Python 3.11 and 3.12 and runs an installed wheel outside the checkout. No provider credentials are needed for normal CI.

Automated scope: Cross-tenant retrieval and export, prompt injection boundaries, quota contention, cache invalidation, consent checks and a separate real PostgreSQL RLS integration job.

Live acceptance remains a separate step: configure only the required provider, use a non-sensitive sample, exercise the real API path, and record model version, call count, usage, latency and any validation error. Do not substitute a demo response when a live request fails. Provider availability, pricing and limits can change independently of the code.

## Troubleshooting

- HTTP 401: verify token scope; provider keys are not application tokens.
- HTTP 409: inspect the original request/state and use the same payload when replaying a request key.
- HTTP 429: inspect the local quota and upstream limits; do not repeat blindly.
- HTTP 502/503: check configured providers, network access or required local models; errors deliberately omit upstream response bodies and credentials.
- SQLite lock errors: keep transactions short and use a single host with persistent storage; plan a database change before multiple replicas.

This version exposes a Python API rather than a JavaScript embed widget. Quotas are lifetime message allocations, not recurring subscription allowances. Leads are stored with consent; no email is sent. SQLite isolation is enforced by service queries; database-level RLS applies only to PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL initialization requires a privileged setup connection and a restricted runtime role. Do not expose the admin connection to clients.
